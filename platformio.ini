	FastLED  ; Grabs the "official" FastLED library.
	; However here we have additional flexibility in that we can pull

	; Here is an example of pulling from the master branch of FastLED library.

	;
	; For example, if you make a fix in the FastLED library in a forked repo
	; then you can pull from your forked repo like this.
